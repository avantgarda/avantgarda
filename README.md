### 👋 Hello

- 🙋‍♂️ I’m Eoin
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, reinforcement learning, web design, app development, augmented reality and much more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about bot and script creation
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything cool...
- 📫 Contact me by starring my repository 😃

### Two of my cooler projects are:

- ⛷️ Augmented reality [implementation](https://github.com/avantgarda/line-rider-ar) of the famous web game, [Line Rider](https://www.linerider.com/). With this project you simply draw the lines on any physical surface, point your phone, and the rider appears to miraclously ride along the lines! And all of this is based only in the browser, no servers required. [Play the game!](https://avantgarda.github.io/line-rider-ar/)
- 🏎️ This [project](https://github.com/avantgarda/f1tenth_gym) builds on the [F1TENTH](https://f1tenth.org/) reinforcement learning environment, allowing it to integrate into [Google Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) for rapid training and testing. F1TENTH is an international autonomous racing competition, where teams compete to create the best driving agent.
