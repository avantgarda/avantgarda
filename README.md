### Some of my favourite projects are:

- ⛷️ [AR Line Rider](https://github.com/avantgarda/line-rider-ar) ---> Augmented reality implementation of the famous web game, [Line Rider](https://www.linerider.com/). With this project you simply draw the lines on any physical surface, point your phone, and the rider appears to miraclously ride along the lines! And all of this is based only in the browser, no servers required. [Play the game!](https://avantgarda.github.io/line-rider-ar/)
- 💁‍♀️ [Staff Tips Tracker](https://github.com/avantgarda/CBRStaff) ---> An Android [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cbr.cbrstaff) to assist with the transparent recording and division of tips amongst staff. After entering the tips and roster for each shift, the division of tips will then be automatically calculated and stored in the outstanding tips page for all to view.
- 🏎️ [F1TENTH Colab RL](https://github.com/avantgarda/f1tenth_gym) ---> This project builds on the [F1TENTH](https://f1tenth.org/) reinforcement learning environment, allowing it to integrate into [Google Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) for rapid training and testing. F1TENTH is an international autonomous racing competition, where teams compete to create the best driving agent.
